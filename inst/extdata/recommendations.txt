general recommendations to repair broken API syntax

<request> is required in the path for <resource>="matrix" and others.  However:

For <resource>="sample" the API currently accepts:

(1) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample/				(<request>="info")
(2) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample?limit=20&order=name		(<request>="query")
(3) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample/mgs25823			(<request>="instance")

and does not accept:

(4) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample/info			(<request>="info")
(5) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample/query		(<request>="query")
(6) http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/sample/instance/mgs25823	(<request>="instance")

Recommendation:
It should not accept (2) or (3), and it should accept (4), (5), (6).
<request> should be required in the path for all <resource>s.

The result of the status quo is that "optional" parameters are not optional for <request>="query".

That is aside from confusion caused by inconsistent syntax.  Related problems exist
for <resource> = 'download','library','metagenome','profile','project','sample','status'





# (1) "id" is required for compute/alphadiversity but not documented as such
# (2) redundant request names within m5nr resource
#     the m5nr resource doc object contains these requests:
#     info,ontology,taxonomy,sources,accession,alias,md5,function,organism,sequence,accession,alias,md5,function,organism,sequence 
#     one reads it and says: wha? 
#     if this is intentional, because requests with the same name are related ... 
#     well, it is confusing to have redundant names ESPECIALLY if they're related!
#     or are they just erroneous duplicates?

# (3) API calls work for validation resource that shouldn't
#     these calls work (indeed they are the provided examples in doc object) yet "id" is 
#     supposedly a required parameter (again according to the doc object):
#         http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/validation/template/
#         http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/validation/data/?template=

validation <template> and validation <data> work without ID but it is a required param
